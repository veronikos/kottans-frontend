   <li>what surprised me:It is quite easy to get familiar with Linux comands. But I don't fully understand hot to theck my files, and use this system correctly.</li>

# Git and GitHub
<img src="https://github.com/veronikos/kottans-frontend/blob/master/Screenshot%20(2).png">
<ul>
   <li>I finished Version Control Course on Udacity. Feel happy to get familiar with powerful instrument Git.</li> 
   <li>I never used it before, so everything was new for me. I have some problems with conflict merging, but I will cope with them later in my activities.</li>
   <li>What surprised me, Is my attitude to studying and a true interest to the lesson. Ilso surprising, but enjoyable is using console, not interface with the buttons in Git.</li>
   <li>Interested to use in the future - merging, branching.</li>
</ul>
