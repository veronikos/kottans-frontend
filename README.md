<img src="https://github.com/veronikos/kottans-frontend/blob/master/task_linux_cli/task_linux_cli.png">
what was new to me: All about linux, before this lesson I only heard of it and knew that it doesn't have a visual interface, only console.
what surprised me:It is quite easy to get familiar with Linux comands. But I don't fully understand hot to theck my files, and use this system correctly.
what I intend to use in future: Linux system on my laptop! I'd like to get more experience using linux. 

# Git and GitHub

I finished Version Control Course on Udacity. Feel happy to get familiar with powerful instrument Git. 
I never used it before, so everything was new for me. I have some problems with conflict merging, but I will cope with them later in my activities.
What surprised me, Is my attitude to studying and a true interest to the lesson. Ilso surprising, but enjoyable is using console, not interface with the buttons in Git.
Interested to use in the future - merging, branching.
