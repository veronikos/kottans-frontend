I finished Version Control Course on Udacity. Feel happy to get familiar with powerful instrument Git. 
I never used it before, so everything was new for me. I have some problems with conflict merging, but I will cope with them later in my activities.
What surprised me, Is my attitude to studying and a true interest to the lesson. Ilso surprising, but enjoyable is using console, not interface with the buttons in Git.
Interested to use in the future - merging, branching.
