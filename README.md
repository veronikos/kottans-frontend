## Git Collaboration
<ul>
<li>what was new to me: working with remote repository, while this course, I had to resolve the isue on hoe to edit the same code from two separate computers (my domestic and one that is at work) Ans now I'm happy to use GitHub for this.</li>
<li>what surprised me: that git is operated so easily from the console GitBash</li>
<li>what you intend to use in future: I'd like to send a pull request to one of the projects on GitHub and get it approved.</li>

what was new to me: All about linux, before this lesson I only heard of it and knew that it doesn't have a visual interface, only console.
what surprised me:It is quite easy to get familiar with Linux comands. But I don't fully understand hot to theck my files, and use this system correctly.
what I intend to use in future: Linux system on my laptop! I'd like to get more experience using linux. 

# Git and GitHub

I finished Version Control Course on Udacity. Feel happy to get familiar with powerful instrument Git. 
I never used it before, so everything was new for me. I have some problems with conflict merging, but I will cope with them later in my activities.
What surprised me, Is my attitude to studying and a true interest to the lesson. Ilso surprising, but enjoyable is using console, not interface with the buttons in Git.
Interested to use in the future - merging, branching.
